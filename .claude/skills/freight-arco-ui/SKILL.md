# Freight Arco UI Skill

Project-level **UI delivery contract** for `FE.OHL.WEB.UI`.

**Source of truth:** `ui-skill/freight-arco-ui/` → run `npm run sync-ui-skill` after edits.

**Synced to:** `.cursor/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`

## Arco-First Productization (read this first)

**Arco drives the page. `global.css` is a thin enhancement layer — not a second UI framework.**

Execution priority (mandatory):

1. **Arco-first** — props, slots, layout primitives, built-in interaction
2. **Token-second** — Arco theme + existing `--dense-*` / semantic tokens
3. **Business-pattern-third** — freight semantics, workbench archetype, VXE bridge
4. **Page-local-css-last** — minimal page shell only

Full rules: **`references/arco-first.md`**. Every shared custom class must state why Arco + tokens were insufficient.

## Architecture

| Layer | Location | Contains |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Arco foundation** | Arco Design Vue | Default owner: controls, layout, tabs, overlay, interaction states |
| **Shared enhancement CSS** | `src/styles/global.css` | Tokens, VXE bridge, freight semantics, documented archetype slots only |
| **Agent summary** | `AGENTS.md` | One-page pointer (no duplicate rules) |
| **This skill** | `SKILL.md` + `references/` | PESDP principles + executable rules |
| **Structure slots** | `module-patterns.md` | English slots only; no field lists |
| **Artifact intake** | `artifact-intake-template.md` | Minimum business context required with screenshot/prototype input |
| **Prototype translation** | `prototype-to-ui-contract.md` | Screenshot/prototype -> business object/archetype/contracts |
| **Feature contracts** | `feature-routing.md`, `feature-delivery-contract.md` | Action/state/permission/API/verification |
| **Domain copy** | `domain-language.md` | Chinese labels, statuses, object examples |
| **Component rules** | `actions.md`, `icons.md`, `table.md`, `detail-form.md`, `list-page.md` | How to implement |
| **QA** | `checklist.md`, `scripts/check-spec.js` | Pre-ship checks |

**Rule:** Arco structure first → business slots and labels from `module-patterns.md` / `domain-language.md` → thin shared enhancement from `global.css` only where needed → details in topic references. Do not duplicate long rule blocks across `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / skill.

## Four-Layer Prompt Model

All agents should understand the project in this order:

1. **Product Positioning** — build a professional freight operations workbench for sales, operators, and coordinators, not a decorative dashboard or traditional ERP sheet.
2. **Design Philosophy** — business workflows, readability, consistency, trust, and operational efficiency come before decoration.
3. **Visual Language** — restrained Arco-based enterprise SaaS: brand-neutral surfaces, white work areas, clear hierarchy, high density, low visual noise; never flat gray ERP or blue-tinted admin.
4. **Implementation Rules** — Arco-first → token-second → business-pattern-third → page-local-css-last; then skill references and `check-spec`.

Do not jump from positioning directly to custom visuals. Every visual decision must pass through philosophy and implementation rules first.

## PESDP

- **Professional** — freight/logistics language and structure
- **Efficient** — fewer lookups, clicks, errors
- **Structured** — identity · operation · auxiliary data separated
- **Dense** — high information, not cramped chaos
- **Premium** — hierarchy and restraint, not decoration

## PESDP+ Operating Principles

- **Consistency** — one design language across tokens, components, spacing, colors, icons, interactions, and behavior.
- **Readability** — key identity, state, amount/date, and next action must be scannable within seconds.
- **Action-first** — operations stay close to the data they affect; use inline actions, drawers, and contextual flows before page transitions.
- **Focus** — each scope has one primary focus and one primary action; avoid competing emphasis points.
- **Trust** — restrained colors, stable layouts, predictable interactions, and clear confirmation for risk.
- **Business Before UI** — visual decisions serve freight workflows and business efficiency before decoration.
- **Information First** — data is the product; visual design improves understanding and must not compete with information.

Priority: **efficiency > information > interaction > visual decoration**

## Operational Workbench Calibration

The product is used by freight sales, operators, and coordinators for continuous office work. The interface must optimize for high-frequency business throughput first, long-session visual comfort second, and visual beauty third.

Target experience: a modern international freight ERP/SaaS workbench. It should preserve dense visible business data, short operation paths, status scanning, and stable repeated workflows while removing old ERP signals such as heavy grids, all-blue buttons, gray form walls, and unclear hierarchy.

For list/workbench pages, aim to keep most first-screen space owned by business data, normally 70-80% when the module is table-dominant. Treat 75% as a workbench target, not a universal rule for detail, review, modal, or exception pages.

Do not hide daily filters, status tabs, or reversible workflow actions merely to look minimal. Modern restraint means neutral grouping, semantic color, and one clear primary anchor, not removing the controls operators need all day.

## First Load (minimal)

1. **`references/arco-first.md`**
2. `references/design-principles.md`
3. `references/module-patterns.md` + `references/domain-language.md` (new pages)
4. For any task with behavior or request flow: `references/feature-routing.md` + `references/feature-delivery-contract.md`
5. For any screenshot/prototype-driven task: `references/artifact-intake-template.md` + `references/prototype-to-ui-contract.md`
6. One topic file from the map below
7. **Before template:** when the page has search or overlays, read `filter-layout.md` and `modal.md`.
8. **Before changing icon usage:** read `icons.md`.
9. **Before any redesign / 布局重写 / 质感优化 / 普通后台味反馈:** read `redesign-calibration.md`.
10. **Before any custom class or `global.css` pattern:** re-check `arco-first.md` and document why Arco + tokens are insufficient.
11. **`src/styles/global.css`** — only after steps 1–10; grep tokens/patterns already justified, do not browse the file as the primary design catalog.

**Coding gate:** `.cursor/rules/spec-first-coding.mdc` — read references first; run `check-spec.js` before delivery.

Optional mirror of an existing page only when the user explicitly asks. Default: skill + Arco docs + justified `global.css` patterns.

## Non-Negotiables

- Arco-first: prefer Arco built-ins, props, slots, and theme behavior before shared custom CSS
- `global.css` is a shared enhancement layer, not a second UI framework
- Arco + `global.css` tokens; no new color system
- `vxe-table` only; no `a-table`
- Freight terms from `domain-language.md`; no generic `步骤1` / `处理中`
- Map business object + user job before layout; no copying order fields to unrelated modules
- Structural classes (`dds-head`, `detail-section`, `table-card-cap`) are slots — content follows the object
- One `primary` per scope; row actions icon + tooltip; danger → confirm
- Generic action icons use Arco; business-semantic identity/menu/empty-state icons use IconPark; no forced icons when the metaphor is weak
- `detail-mini-vxe`: no `show-overflow`; header bg ≠ row hover bg; no checkbox without batch toolbar
- Business Arco controls: `size="small"` only — see `component-size.md` (`medium` = Arco default, forbidden)
- When the task is redesign, AI may regroup surfaces or rewrite the page skeleton if business workflow becomes clearer; do not default to structure-preserving polish. See `redesign-calibration.md`.
- When the task goal is productization, sellable SaaS quality, financing/demo quality, or "高级感", evaluate against `product-grade-evaluation.md`; do not stop at internal-system quality.
- Any feature with click/submit/request/state change must complete the functional contract: `feature_type` + `entry_point` + `actor_roles` + `visible_when` + `enabled_when` + `api_request` + `api_response` + `success_result` + `error_result` + `refresh_scope` + `verification_cases`
- Any screenshot/prototype-driven task must complete the artifact intake template and prototype translation block before coding
- Any screenshot/prototype-driven task must complete the prototype translation block before coding; do not code directly from visual similarity
- UI rules must be written as AI-executable design language: scope + structure/class + token/density + state + business semantics + forbidden fallback. Vague taste rules like “更好看/更有质感/不要贴在一起” must be translated before coding.

## Working Protocol

1. Fill slot mapping (`module-patterns.md` template).
2. If the task comes from a screenshot/prototype, complete the artifact intake template.
3. If the task comes from a screenshot/prototype, complete the prototype translation block.
4. If the task has behavior, classify `feature_type` and complete the functional contract.
5. Pick archetype; read topic references.
6. Implement in priority order: Arco built-ins → tokens → documented business patterns → minimal page-local CSS. Shared classes only when `arco-first.md` justification is clear.
7. Run `node scripts/check-spec.js` and build when possible.
8. Report object mapping, artifact intake, prototype mapping, feature mapping, files changed, rules applied, verification.

## Output Standard

- Slot mapping + archetype (design/generation tasks)
- Artifact intake block (screenshot/prototype-driven tasks)
- Prototype translation block (screenshot/prototype-driven tasks)
- Feature mapping + delivery contract keys (behavior tasks)
- Files changed
- Rules applied
- Verification run
- Remaining risks
